By clicking the buttons on our navigation bar, Home, Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner, and Dessert you will be sent to the page which displays the corresponding menu items for that category.

On each page there will be a link that will be embedded into the name of each recipe. Clinking on that link will bring you to another website which has the entire recipe for that dish.

Under each link will be a short description and a picture of the food item that relates to the recipe.

Thats about it. We hope you enjoyed it!
